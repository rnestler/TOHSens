TOHSens
=======

This tool is for reading I2C sensors connected to the Other half bus of your Jolla phone.

Much of the I2C code is from https://github.com/kimmoli/i2ctool 

Currently the SHTC1
(http://www.sensirion.com/en/products/humidity-temperature/humidity-temperature-sensor-shtc1/)
is the only supported sensor
